# DSND-Cpastone_Pharma_Stocks

## Project Overview:

In my capstone project I am exploring the movements of stock prices creating traditional finantial varialbes (MACD, RSI, Rolling Averages) and applying some machine learning technics, trying to predict the movements of stock prices only for educational reasons

Data I use is from yahoo finance. As input I take daily trading data: opening price (Open), highest price the stock traded at (High), how many stocks were traded (Volume) and closing price adjusted for stock splits and dividends (Adjusted Close).

First I am looking at the development of adj close stock prices by means of comparing a visualising different trading parameters: Daily returns, Cumulative returnes, Rolling statistics of mean, standard deviation and Bollinger Bands, as well as MACD and RSI. These parameters show, how risky (or volatile) are the stock prices, how profitable they are and what investing logic could be used. Several of these techniques indeed have some power to predict stock prices movements.

After looking at the trading parameters, I am going forward in my analysis of stock prices movements by means of machine learning models.
